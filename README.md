# Jude Beaton's Personal GitHub
I am currently in my second year studying Computer Science (MEng) at The University of Bristol.
This repository contains all the projects that I work on outside of my studies, including my own passion projects, work from online textbooks, and code followed from online tutorials.
I am very interested in deep learning, computer graphics and optimising algorithms. My main project that I am working on currently is a convolutional neural network that is built from scratch in python, that will be able to learn to beat the game Minesweeper, hopefully I can apply knowledge from this project to more real world applications in the future!
